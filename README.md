## Versions
### AeonLabs improved Hot Solder Reflow Plate
- revision 2.x (ToDo)
  - Android App to view and control the hot plate temperature

- revison 1.x
  - ESP32 MCU with BLE and WiFi
  - 2x Temperature seensors for improved management of Reflow temperature
  - 12VDC (5A Minimum)
  - 5.5mm x 2.5mm Barrel Jack
  - With corner M7.5 holes for placement of an aluminium plate on top of the PCB for extended lifetime and durability
  - Electronic components placed on the bottom side for extended lifetime and improved duraility
  - Aluminium plate can now be exported as Gerber to [FlatCAM](http://flatcam.org) and drilled using [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle) 
  
 *FlatCAM settings*
 
 Feed Rate: 0.3-0.5
 
 Depth pass: 1.1 mm (unless your setup your CNC with Z-height correction; for a 8mm thick aluminium plate)
 
 Tool: 2mm or 0.07874 inch
 
 pass overlap: 0.0

## As Seen On GreatScott! 
This is the Gerber & KiCad files for the Youtuber GreatScott! video "The Best way to reflow solder? Hot Plate to the rescue! DIY or Buy"
Check it out here - [The Best way to reflow solder? Hot Plate to the rescue! DIY or Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QarizoUnRfk)


You have 2 options:

Download this repository for the KiCad Files

Or,

Download the Gerber files in the release section of this repository

### alternatively if you do not want to build a PCB by yourself, you can buy here:

[Tidie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/aeonlabs/solder-reflow-plate-with-nextion-lcd-touch/)

The price will be around 30eur plus postage fees.
(I will also deliver the assembled PCB with all the components in place at an aditonal cost).
